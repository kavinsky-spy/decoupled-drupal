# Drupal-Composable
The modern Drupal way to create content.

This project aims to create and manage content in a modular and reusable way. Instead of traditional monolithic content structures, where content is designed as a single, unchangeable entity, composable separates the content into smaller, reusable components that can be assembled and rearranged to create different types of content and layouts, making them more flexible and adaptable.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your Drupal site is used as CMS API first using GraphQL + GraphQL Composer or JSON:API (implementation TBD)
